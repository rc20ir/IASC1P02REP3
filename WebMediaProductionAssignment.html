    <!-- Paragraphs with styled text -->
    <p><strong>Pandas</strong> are very unique creatures and are descendants of the <em>bear family</em>. They are fluffy white and black creatures that carry various skills such as: excellent <em>camouflage</em> for their habitat such as snow, they are great climbers and swimmers, and they have an <em>extended wrist bone</em> that they use like a thumb to help them grip food.</p>
    <p>Despite their lack of natural predators, <strong>pandas</strong> are still at risk. There are only <strong>1800 pandas</strong> in the wild currently known and it's mainly due to <em>habitat loss</em>. Wild pandas once roamed bamboo forests in China, Vietnam, and Laos. Today, found only in <em>China</em>.</p>
