    <h2>About Alzheimer's</h2>
    <p>
      Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory and cognitive function.
      It is the most common cause of dementia, and its prevalence is increasing as the population ages. As we age,
      our brains typically shrink to a certain degree in a healthy manner; however, large numbers of neurons are not
      lost. In Alzheimer's disease, many neurons lose their function and connections with other neurons, causing widespread damage to
      the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.
