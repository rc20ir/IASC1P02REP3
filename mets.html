      <h2>What is Metabolic Syndrome?</h2>
      <p>
        Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.
        It includes abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low HDL cholesterol, and high triglycerides. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is the collective of five co-occurring vascular risk factors; affecting 50% of adults aged over 60 years. An abnormal accumulation of amyloid and tau proteins in the brain marks the progression of AD. Amyloid is an insoluble, highly dominated β-sheet structure, that unlike other proteins, doesn’t currently have a structural, supportive, or motility role (Rambaran et al., 2008). All that’s understood mostly is that they have a pathogenic effect. Thus, a link between MetS and AD development has potential that has not yet been fully explored. For one to diagnosis metabolic syndrome, the presence of three or more body mass, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and hypertension related health conditions must be apparent as they increase heart disease risk.

        <h2>Exercise for a Healthier Life</h2>
        <p>
          Regular physical activity is crucial in managing metabolic syndrome. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.
          Incorporate activities like walking, jogging, or cycling into your routine.
